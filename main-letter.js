  `I donâ€™t know how to begin this without my voice trembling through every word,<br>but maybe trembling is how the truth walks when itâ€™s been buried too long.<br>So here it is â€” soft, trembling, but still true:<br><strong>Iâ€™m sorry.</strong><br>Not just for the silence. Not just for the mess.<br>But for every time I touched your world without steady hands,<br>for every moment I made you feel less,<br>when all you ever did was give me more.`,

  `Amandaâ€¦<br>You were poetry in a world that taught me only noise.<br>And I â€” a boy drowning in static,<br>tried to hold a symphony without learning the melody.<br>You gave me oceans, I came with a cracked cup.<br>You brought constellations, I showed up with shadows.`,

  `But God, how I loved you.<br>Even in my confusion, even in my chaos â€”<br>my soul whispered your name like a prayer,<br>like maybe if I said it enough, Iâ€™d become the man you needed.<br>But I didnâ€™t. Not fast enough.<br>Not deep enough.<br>And for that, I ache.`,

  `You saw me.<br>In ways no one else did.<br>You kissed the bruises I hid from the world,<br>you traced your fingers over my fears,<br>and told me I was still worthy of love.<br>And what did I do?<br>I broke the very heart that was willing to fight for me.`,

  `Iâ€™m not proud.<br>Iâ€™m not writing this to paint over what happened.<br>I just want you to know:<br>if love was a language,<br>you were the poem I never learned how to read until you were gone.`,

  `Amanda, if I could go backâ€¦<br>Iâ€™d hold your hand tighter.<br>Iâ€™d ask how your soul was â€” not just your day.<br>Iâ€™d kiss your forehead longer.<br>Iâ€™d stay up late just to hear your sleepy voice say "goodnight."<br>Iâ€™d show up.<br>Not half, not almost â€” but fully.`,

  `I miss your laugh.<br>That little nervous one when you were pretending to be mad.<br>I miss how you said my name like it had roots in your chest.<br>I miss your honesty â€” even when it hurt.<br>I miss us â€” whatever version of us that was still growing, still learning.`,

  `But more than missing,<br>Iâ€™ve learned.<br>About myself.<br>About love.<br>About how fragile hearts are, and how sacred trust is.<br>And Iâ€™ll never treat either carelessly again.`,

  `Amandaâ€¦<br>You were not just a chapter.<br>You were a whole damn novel I never finished reading.<br>And maybe the story ended.<br>Or maybe it paused.`,

  `But wherever you are now â€”<br>I want you to know, with every fiber of my soul:<br>You mattered.<br>You still do.<br>And even if I never get to call you "mine" again,<br>youâ€™ll always be the girl who woke something holy in me.`,

  `So this is not a cry to win you back.<br>This is just a man who finally found the words,<br>standing in the ruins of what he ruined,<br>saying â€”<br><strong>Iâ€™m sorry. I loved you. I still doâ€¦</strong> in a way only healed hearts understand.`,

  `Forever holding you in the quiet of my prayers,<br>â€” Moses`
